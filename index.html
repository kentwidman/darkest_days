				<p>When I'd tell people in my little hometown about the big summer trip I was about to
				undertake, I'd get two types of responses. Half of them would say, or rather yell, "Son, you are
				out of your mind! Why would you wanna go all the way out there?"</p>
				<p>Okay, maybe it was more than half. People in my town aren't exactly the most open-
				minded.</p>
				<p>My mom was part of this group. "Now, Xavier," she'd say, gently but trying her best to be
				persuasive. "Please tell me again, where's this city you're so crazy about going to, anyway?"
				"It's in Europe, mom."</p>
				<p>"But I just don't understand why you have to start packing already. When are you
				leaving?"</p>
				<p>"Saturday, mom. I leave on Saturday."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Then there was the small number that would be slightly more encouraging. Dad was in
				this bunch. "Son, I admit it&#8217;s a good thing that somebody's actually getting out of this little town
				for once. And hey, you've always had that adventurous spirit."</p>
				<p>But they too had their warnings. "I'm just concerned, traveling all by yourself like that, it
				can be dangerous!"</p>
				<p>"I'll be all right, dad."</p>
				<p>"But you'll get really lonely, son. And knowing you, your imagination is going to play
				tricks=="</p>
				<p>"Dad..."</p>
				<p>"Okay, okay. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you're going. I really am. But... why couldn't
				you wait until you found a nice lady around here, settled down, and then went for a trip?"</p>

				<p>Only my little brother really got it. Mom claimed that to Matt I was an idol, and maybe
				she had a point. He thought I was a badass for going to another country all by myself. He even
				helped me pack.</p>
				<p>But, surprise surprise, even he had doubts.</p>
				<p>"Dude, X, you know I think this is the coolest thing, but tell me--"</p>
				<p>"Hmm?"</p>
				<p>"Why this... Stock-home of all places?"</p>
				<p>"Ah... that's a good question, Matty. "</p>
				<p>"So what's the answer?"</p>
				<p>"Well, that's a secret!"</p>
				<p>"Hey, that's not fair."</p>
				<br>
				<p>But fair or not, I finished packing up all my stuff. And after a painful, agonizing wait, the
				day had finally come: Saturday had arrived! I hugged my mom, got a manly pat in the back from
				my dad, and messed up Matt's hair. Then I stepped outside and said hello to the cab driver that
				was ready to take me to the airport.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This was it: I was on my way!</p>

				<p>Now, I tell you, the single thing I was most looking forward to about traveling -especially traveling by myself- was that, in all these faraway cities and countries, nobody would know me.
				That might seem weird at first, but see, the place I grew up in, it's a little farming town nobody's
				heard of, whose single claim to fame is being exactly equidistant between Chicago,
				Indianapolis, and Detroit. Which would be kinda neat if it didn't mean that it still takes hours to
				get to any of them. And which is even less neat because in reality it's inaccurate: we're actually
				to a few miles closer to Indy than to any of the other two. But anyway, in a town like that,
				everyone knows everyone else. Which might sound nice, initially. But everyone knows everyone
				else a little too well. Meaning everyone constantly gets all up in your business.</p>
				<p>I must've completely dozed off while thinking about this stuff, because I have to admit I
				remember very little about the actual flight to Europe. My mind jumped from one hazy dream to
				the next, and I was only finally woken by a pleasant female voice on the intercom.</p>
				<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Brussels."</p>

				<p>It was after getting out of the plane that the notion of being in an unfamiliar land -of actually being there- really hit me. Finally, here, here in the waiting queue as all the passengers lined up to get our passports checked, were travelers from all over the world, waiting for our connecting flights to different places in a new hemisphere. People of so many races, of so many languages, with so many histories! And I was just one more traveler, one of the many. With that knowledge came a kind of thrill: absolutely nobody would ask about why I was out watching a movie instead of doing homework, no familiar faces to ask whether I was dating anyone, nobody would even know my name.</p>
				<p>And then I heard it.</p>
				<p>"Hey, Xavier!"</p>
				<p>I had to make sure it wan't my mind playing a trick on me. I looked up where the voice
				was coming from: it sounded like it came from near the front of the line.</p>
				<p>"Hey, Xavier!"</p>
				<p>Yup, that was definitely my name. But it wasn't a voice I recognized. Maybe there was
				another Xavier around.</p>
				<p>But nobody else looked up.</p>
				<p>I stood up on my tiptoes and peered harder through the crowd, and I realized I hadn't
				been mistaken. Indeed, right near the front of the line, someone was turning back and waving at
				me. It was a lady: dark-haired, medium height, pale skin, with lively eyes looking right at me
				from behind thin-rimmed glasses. She was dressed rather elegantly, though somewhat warm
				for this time of year: black leather coat and colorful, patterned scarf. I wasn't sure how old the
				lady looked&#8212;maybe thirty or thirty-five. What I was sure of was that I'd never seen her before in
				my life.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Then the lady did something quite peculiar: she raised her right hand in what looked like
				a victory sign; and then she raised her left hand, let her thumb and pinky come together, and
				held up her remaining three fingers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Then, perhaps sensing my confusion, she yelled out, "Twenty-three, Xavier! Twenty-three!"</p>
				<br>
				<p>There wasn't time for much more of an explanation. Her turn at the passport counter
				came up, she gave me a quick wave, and that was it. I tried to wave through my multinational,
				multiethnic queue, but to no avail.</p>
				<p>She was gone.</p>
